# ADR 0014: Session card

Status: accepted, 2026-09-29.

## Decision

- The daemon keeps each session's last 20 hook events (`domain.SessionEvent`: kind, time, tool, one-line detail, and the permission, notification or assistant text). `domain.SessionEventFromHook` reduces a payload to that; text is capped at 4000 bytes.
- The store persists them in `session_events` (migration 0003), appended by `PutEvent` in the same write-behind batch as everything else and pruned to the newest 20 per session in that transaction. They load back into the snapshot on start.
- A hook publishes one diff carrying both the session and its event (`Diff.Event`, alongside `Diff.Session`), and the snapshot has `State.Events`. Ordinary diffs still set one field.
- `domain.BuildSessionCard(task, session, worktrees, events)` is the only place the card is derived, and it reads nothing but those arguments. It gives the task label, PR chips from the session's worktrees, the last 3 `pre_tool_use` calls (newest first), and the waiting reason:
  - `permission`: the latest permission request's text.
  - `waiting`: the last assistant message's closing paragraph if it ends in `?`, else the notification message.
  - `done`: the closing question, if there is one.
  - Only events after the last user prompt count. The text is verbatim, cut to 3 lines with a trailing `…`.
- The TUI renders the card for the selected session above the sidebar footer, from the events it already holds. It is hidden when the pane is under 24 rows or the help is open. Agent text is stripped of escape sequences and control characters before it is drawn.

## Why

- "Derives only from stored events" means the card must survive a daemon restart and be testable from a fixture log, so the events are stored and the builder is pure.
- Keeping 20 per session bounds memory, disk and snapshot size; the card needs 3 actions and one prompt.
- One diff for session and event means a subscriber never shows a state without the event that explains it.
- The main pane belongs to the agent, so "the session header area" is the sidebar, next to the selected row.

## Limits

- `Task` has no URL field, so the card shows the task's ref (for example `#42`), not a link, until tasks carry one.
- A permission prompt longer than the pane is cut at the pane's width per line, not wrapped, so the 3-line rule holds.

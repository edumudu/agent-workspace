# ADR 0023: Review pane, turn snapshots and the diff cache

Status: accepted, 2026-09-30.

## Decision

- **Scopes** are a domain rule: `RangeFor(scope, facts)` says where each diff starts (`last_turn` → the newest turn ref, `uncommitted` → `HEAD`, `branch` → merge base with `origin/<default>`). Every scope ends at the working tree, untracked files included.
- **Working tree as a tree.** The git adapter copies the worktree's index to a temp file, runs `git add -A` and `git write-tree` against it (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`), and diffs `git diff <from> <tree>`. The real index and the worktree are never touched. Copying the index keeps git's stat cache, so only changed files are hashed.
- **Turn snapshots.** On every `UserPromptSubmit`, a worker commits that tree (`commit-tree`, author `agentws`) and points `refs/agentws/turns/<session>/<worktree key>/<n>` at it, then deletes the session's older turns in that worktree. The worktree key is 12 hex chars of the SHA-1 of its path, because worktrees of one repo share refs. When the scanner sees a worktree removed, it deletes every turn ref of that worktree from the main checkout.
- **Cache.** `app.Reviewer` keeps parsed diffs by `<resolved from commit>..<tree hash>`, 128 entries, FIFO. Reopening an unchanged review runs `write-tree` and `rev-parse` but no `git diff`.
- **Where it runs.** `review.open` builds on the connection goroutine, at most 4 worktrees at once; snapshots and ref cleanup run on workers. Nothing touches git on the loop. The TUI highlights and lays out a review in the command that fetched it, so `View` only paints.
- **Viewed marks** are `{worktree, path, blob}`, stored in SQLite (`viewed` table, migration 0004). A mark counts only while the file's blob (from the diff's `index` line) is the one that was viewed, so it resets as soon as the file changes again.
- **Layout.** `r` calls `client.review`, which resizes the sidebar pane to 75% of the window and re-points its `window-resized` hook at that width; closing puts back 48 columns. The sidebar collapses to a rail of glyphs and numbers.
- **Highlighting** uses chroma's lexer engine with a curated set of its XML lexers copied into `internal/tui/syntax/` (MIT, `COPYING` kept) plus its Go rules, built on first use. Colors come from the theme, not chroma's styles.

## Why

- `git stash create`, the issue's suggestion, leaves untracked files out, so a file created before the prompt would show up as part of the turn. A tree from a temp index covers them and gives one code path for snapshots and diffs.
- chroma's `lexers` and `styles` packages build every lexer and style in `init`, about 7 ms per process; the binary is also `agentws hook`, whose budget is 20 ms p95. With the curated set chroma's init is under 0.1 ms.
- Keeping one snapshot per session and worktree bounds the refs; the scope only needs the latest.

## Rejected

- **Snapshotting with `git stash create`:** misses untracked files (above).
- **Diffing in Go:** the architecture says diffs come from `git diff`.
- **Keeping all turns:** refs grow without bound and nothing reads older turns yet.
- **Persisting viewed marks in the TUI:** the TUI does no disk IO; the daemon owns state.

## Consequences

- A prompt's snapshot can land a few milliseconds after the agent starts editing on a large repo; that edit then counts as before the turn.
- A worktree with a huge untracked, non-ignored directory makes `git add -A` slow; it runs off the loop, but the review waits for it.
- Stage and revert per hunk, comments and nvim are separate issues; the footer shows only the keys that work.
